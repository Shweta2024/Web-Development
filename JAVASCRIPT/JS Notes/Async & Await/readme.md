## Async 

- The async keyword allows you to define a function that handles asynchronous operations.

- Async functions will always return a value. It makes sure that a promise is returned and if it is not returned then javascript automatically wraps it in a promise which is resolved with its value.


## Await

- await is used to wait for a promise to get settle either in the resolved state or in the rejected state.

- await keyword is used only inside async function.
