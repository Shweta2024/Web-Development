## we are having 02 types of databases :- 
- SQL : Structured Query Language
- NoSQL : Not Only Structured Query Language

## SQL 

- also known as Relation-Database.
- stores data in tabular format.
- eg : MySQL

## NoSQL

- also known as Non-Relational Database.
- stores data as JSON objects.
- eg : MongoDBüçÉ

## when to use what?
- When are having datas such that they are highy related to each other in that case we should use SQL, because its good at handling relationships between different tables.
When we aren't having datas that are highly related then we can use NoSQL.

- Also, when there are lots of missing values in our data then prefer using NoSQL, because in SQL since the data are represented in tabular format so it will insert NULL inplace of empty value which isn't suitable. 

- When we are having huge data in that case storing data in tabular format won't be possible because if we'll organize data in something like excel then on increasing data it will slow down and at point will stop working due to insufficient storage.
