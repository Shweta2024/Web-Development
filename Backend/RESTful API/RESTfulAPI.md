**RE**presentational
**S**tate
**T**ransfer -> It is an Architectural style for designing APIs.

Some other Architectural styles for designing APIS are :- **GraphQL**, **Soap**, **Falcor** etc.

### Two rules of REST :- 

1) Use HTTP Request verbs

    The HTTP verbs are :- GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE.

2) Use specific pattern of Routes/Endpoint URLs.


Comparision of HTTP requests with CRUD operations in DB :- 
- **GET** is similar to **READ**
- **POST** is similar to **CREATE**
- **PUT** & **PATCH** is similar to **UPDATE**
- **DELETE** is similar to **DELETE**

Difference between **PUT** & **PATCH**?

- **PUT** : It updates a document by completely replcing it with another document.

- **PATCH** : It  updates a document by updating a specific field of document.
