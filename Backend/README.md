### Backend consists of :- 

1) **Server**
2) **Application**
3) **Database**

Backend technology :- Node.js
Framework used with it :- express

### Why do we use node.js?
- JavaScript allows us to interact with the browser including taking inputs from prompts and showing alerts.But it doesn't allows us to interact with the computer file system,like we cannot access a file which is in our local system using JavaScript.
Therefore we use node.js as it allows us to access the computer files and also to interact with the hardware.

- to run a JavaScript file write :- ```js node index.js``` (if index.js is the name of the js file).

- **REPL(Read Evaluaton Print Loops)** :- its like the google console,like google console it allows us to execute chucks of codes.We can write a line of code and can hit enter to execute it and can write another line of code after that and again hit enter to execute it.

- **npm - Node Package Manager** 
npm is two things: first, it is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects; second, it is a command-line utility for interacting with said repository that helps in package installation, version management, and dependency management.

- **Express** :- its a framework of node.
