## APIs -> Application Programming Interfaces

### What is an API?
An **Application Programming Interface(API)** is a set of commands, functions, protocols, and objects that programmers can use to **create software** or **interact with an external system.**

- jQuery API :- we used jQuery to create software.
- Tinder shows shared friends, its because its uses the facebook API and that is an example of using api to interact with external system.

We can consider it like a contract between the data providers and the developer.The data providers mentions that these are the data that the developers can use and with these commands, functions, protocols and objects and the data providers won't make any changes to these commands, functions, protocols and objects without notifying the developers.


## API

1) Endpoint :- starting url

2) Paths

3) Parameters

4) Authentication

- we can use paths and parameters to narrow down to the data that we want

https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Programming?type=single&contains=debugging

Endpoint :- https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/

Paths :- Programming

**JSON** -> JavaScript Object Notation

In JSON, data is represented in key-value pairs, and curly braces hold objects, where a colon is followed after each name. The comma is used to separate key-value pairs.
