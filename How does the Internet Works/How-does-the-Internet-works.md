### We can consider INTERNET as large wire that connects different computers with each other such that they can talk and share data with each other through the internet.

- #### Now some of the computer attached to the internet has a very special job and has to be 24X7 hours ready to serve all the files and data that we are requesting.The computers that are doing that job are called the **SERVER**.
    
- #### The computers that any user would use to access the internet is called a **CLIENT**.

 We can consider SERVER as a giant library that's open 24 X 7 hours and we can go their and requests for any data that we want.
 Now since its a giant library so it will be having lots of data in it and it would be difficult to locate the data that we are looking for.
 
 #### So, how is this problem solved in the internet?

1. Suppose you type www.google.com on your computer, so that you want to go to the home page of google.

2. Now the browser that you are using will send a message to your **Internet Service Provider**(the people whom we pay to access the internet).

3. The ISP will then relate that message to the **DNS Server(Domain Name System Server)**.

4. The DNS then looks in its database that what is the exact IP address of the website that we are trying to access.
- Each computer connected through the internet has an IP Adress,that's like a postal address of the computer.So when the computers needs to send or recieve files
over internet,then each computers can be located by their unique IP Address.

<br>
5. Once the DNS finds the IP Address of the website that we are trying to access,then it sends it back to our computer.So now we know the exact IP Address of google
home page.

<br>
6. Now once we have got the IP Address of the website we want ot access,so our **Browswer** will directly send request to that address throught the 
**Internet Service Provider** and it sends that message via the **Internet Backbone** to the **Server** that is located at that IP Address.

<br>
7. Now that server is the Google server in our example, and that server has all the files that we'll require to view the home page of google on our computer.
So, the server will send all those files via the Internet Backbone to our browser and we are then able to see the home page of google.
And all this process takes only milli seconds.
